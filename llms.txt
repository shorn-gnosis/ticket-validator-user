# Circles DappCon Ticket Validator

> A suite of web applications for validating NFT tickets on the Gnosis Chain, built for DappCon using the Unlock Protocol. The project consists of multiple validator apps targeting different user roles: staff validators, end-users, and a standalone validator.

This project enables ticket validation for blockchain-based event tickets (NFTs) issued through the Unlock Protocol. The system includes staff and user validator apps, QR code scanning functionality, and support for mixed-case Ethereum addresses. The validators connect to the Gnosis Chain to verify NFT ownership using ethers.js and the Unlock Protocol smart contracts.
